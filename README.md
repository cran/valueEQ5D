# valueEQ5D
EQ-5D is a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol(R) Group as a measure of health-related quality of life that can be used in a wide range of health conditions and treatments (https://euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/). The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system and a visual analog scale (VAS).

The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The EQ-5D VAS records the patient’s self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale. This can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient’s own judgement. The scores on these five dimensions can be presented as a health profile or can be converted to a single summary index number (utility) reflecting preferability compared to other health profiles.

This package can be used for valuing the adult EQ-5D descriptive system scores - both 5L and 3L for different countries.EQ-5D-5L scores can be valued for the following countries: Canada,China,England,Germany,HongKong,Indonesia, Ireland,Japan,Korea,Malaysia,Netherlands,Spain,Taiwan,Thailand,and Uruguay while EQ-5D-3L scores can be valued for the countries Belgium,Brazil,Canada,Chile,Denmark,Europe,Finland,France,Germany,Italy,Japan,Korea,Netherlands,NewZealand, Poland,Portugal,Slovenia,Spain,Taiwan,Thailand,UK,USA,Zimbabwe, and Trinidad_and_Tobago. The 5L descriptive scores can be mapped to 3L index values for UK using the National Institute of Care and Excellence (NICE) recommended Van Hout et al. method.
